Scilla by Example
==================


HelloWorld
###################

We start off by writing a classical ``HelloWorld.scilla`` contract with the
following  specification:


+ It should have an `immutable variable` ``owner`` to be initialized by the
  creator of the contract. The variable is immutable in the sense that once
  initialized, its value cannot be changed. ``owner`` will be of type
  ``Address``. 

+ It should have a `mutable variable` ``welcome_msg`` of type ``String``
  initialized to ``""``. Mutability here refers to the possibility of modifying
  the value of a variable even after the contract has been deployed.

+ The ``owner`` and **only her** should be able to modify ``welcome_msg``
  through an interface ``setHello``. The interface takes a ``msg`` (of type
  ``String``) as input and  allows the ``owner`` to set the value of
  ``welcome_msg`` to ``msg``. 

+ It should have an interface ``getHello`` that welcomes any caller with
  ``welcome_msg``. ``getHello`` will not take any input. 


Defining Contract and its (Im)Mutable Fields
**************************************************

A contract is declared using the ``contract`` keyword that starts the scope of
the contract. The keyword is followed by the name of the contract which will be
``HelloWorld`` in our example. So, the following code fragment declares a
```HelloWorld`` contract. 

.. code-block:: ocaml

    contract HelloWorld


.. note::
	In the current implementation, a Scilla contract can only contain a single
	contract declaration and hence any code that follows the ``contract``
	keyword is part of the contract declaration. In other words, there is no
	explicit keyword to declare the end of the contract definition.



A contract declaration is followed by the  declaration of its immutable
variables, the scope of which is defined by ``()``.  Each immutable variable is
declared in the following way: ``vname: vtype``, where ``vname`` is the
variable name and ``vtype`` is the variable type. Immutable variables are
separated by ``,``.  As per the specification, the contract will have only one
immutable variable ``owner`` of type ``Address`` and hence the following code
fragment.  


.. code-block:: ocaml

    (owner: Address)

Mutable variables in a contract are declared through keyword ``field``. Each
mutable variable is declared in the following way: ``field vname : vtype =
init_val``, where ``vname`` is the variable name, ``vtype`` is its type and
``init_val`` is the value to which the variable has to be initialized.  The
``HelloWorld`` contract has one mutable parameter ``welcome_msg`` of type
``String`` initialized to ``""``. This yields the following code fragment:

.. code-block:: ocaml

    field welcome_msg : String = ""


At this stage, our ``HelloWorld.scilla`` contract will have the following form
that includes the contract name and its (im)mutable variables:

.. code-block:: ocaml

    contract HelloWorld
    (owner: Address)

    field welcome_msg : String = ""

    

.. note::
        In addition to these fields, any contract in Scilla has an implicitly
        declared mutable field balance (initialised upon the contractâ€™s
        creation), which keeps the amount of funds held by the contract.  This
        field can be freely read within the implementation, but can only
        modified by explicitly transferring funds to other accounts.



Defining Interfaces `aka` Transitions
***************************************

Interfaces like ``setHello`` are referred to as `transitions` in Scilla.
Transitions are similar to `functions` or `methods` in other languages.  


.. note::
	The term `transition` comes from the underlying computation model in Scilla
	which follows a communicating automaton. A contract in Scilla is an
	automaton with some state. The state of an automaton can be changed via a
	transition that takes a previous state and an input and yields a new state.
	Check `wikipedia entry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_system>`_
	to read more about transition systems.

A transition is declared using the keyword ``transition``. The end of a
transition scope is declared using the keyword ``end``. The ``transition``
keyword is followed by the transition name, which is ``setHello`` for our
example. Then follows the input parameters within ``()``. Each input parameter
is separated by a ``,`` and is declared in the following format: ``vname :
vtype``.  According to the specification, ``setHello`` takes only one parameter
of name ``msg`` of type ``String``.  This yields the following code fragment:

.. code-block:: ocaml

    transition setHello (msg : String)

What follows the transition signature is the body of the transition. Code for
the first transition ``setHello (msg :  String)`` to set ``welcome_msg`` is
given below: 



.. code-block:: ocaml
    :linenos:

    transition setHello (msg : String)
      is_owner = builtin eq owner _sender;
      match is_owner with
      | False =>
        msg = {_tag : "Main"; _recipient : _sender; _amount : Uint128 0; code : not_owner_code};
        msgs = one_msg msg;
        send msgs
      | True =>
        welcome_msg := msg;
        msg = {_tag : "Main"; _recipient : _sender; _amount : Uint128 0; code : set_hello_code};
        msgs = one_msg msg;
        send msgs
      end
    end

At first, the caller of the transition is checked against the ``owner`` using
the instruction ``builtin eq owner _sender`` in ``Line 2``. In order to compare
two addresses, we are using the function ``eq`` defined as a ``builtin``
operator. The operator returns a boolean value ``True`` or ``False``. 


.. note::

    Scilla internally defines some variables that have special semantics. These
    special variables are often prefixed by ``_``. For instance, ``_sender`` in
    Scilla refers to the account address that called the current contract.

Depending on the output of the comparison, the transition takes a different path
declared via `pattern matching`, the syntax of which is given in the fragment
below. 

.. code-block:: ocaml

	match expr with
	| x => expr_1
	| y => expr_2
        end 

The above code checks whether ``expr`` evaluates to ``x`` or ``y``. If ``expr``
evaluates to ``x``, then the next expression to be evaluated will be
``expr_1``, else if it evaluates to ``y``, then, the next expression to be
evaluated will be ``expr_2``. Simply put, the above code implements an
``if-then-else`` instruction. 
  
Caller is not owner
""""""""""""""""""""""""

In case the caller is different from ``owner``, the transition takes the
``False`` branch and the contract sends out a message. Scilla defines a special
type ``Message`` for outgoing messages. An outgoing message contains
information about any other contract that needs to be called (as a part of the
current call) or values that need to be returned. 

The output message in this case is an error code ``not_owner_code`` included in
``msg``.  More concretely, the output message in this case is:

.. code-block:: ocaml

        msg = {_tag : "Main"; _recipient : _sender; _amount : Uint128 0; code : not_owner_code};


        
An outgoing message is formed of  ``vname : value`` pairs delimited by ``;``,
the scope of which is defined by ``{}``. Each outgoing message must have
three compulsory fields: ``_tag``, ``_recipient`` and ``_amount`` in no
particular order. ``_recipient`` is an account address to which the message
will be sent. ``_tag`` is the name of the transition to be invoked in
``_recipient`` and ``_amount`` is the number of ZIL to be transferred to
``_recipient``. 

Apart from these compulsory fields, a message may have other fields. In the
current example, the message has a field ``code`` to report an error message.


Sending a message out is done using the ``send`` instruction that takes a list
of entries of type ``Message``. In the current example, the list will contain
only one entry.  To sum up, the following code will create a message and send
it out.

.. code-block:: ocaml

        msgs = one_msg msg;
        send msgs

``one_msg`` is a utility function that allows to create a list of messages and
inserts ``msg`` into the list.


Caller is owner
""""""""""""""""""""""""

In case the caller is ``owner``, the contract allows the caller to set the
value of the mutable variable ``welcome_msg`` to the input parameter ``msg``.
It is done through the following instruction. 


.. code-block:: ocaml

	welcome_msg := msg; 


.. note::
 
    Writing to a mutable parameter is done via the operator ``:=``.



And as in the previous case, the contract then sends out a message to the caller
with the code ``code : set_hello_code``. 


Libraries 
***************

A Scilla contract may come with some helper libraries that declare purely
functional (with no state manipulation) components of a contract. A library is
declared in the preamble of a contract using the keyword ``library`` followed by
the name of the library. In our current example a library declaration would
look like the following:


 
.. code-block:: ocaml

	library HelloWorld

In our example, the library will include the definition of the error codes as
given below defined using standard ``let x = y in expr`` construct. 

.. code-block:: ocaml

	let not_owner_code  = Int32 1
	let set_hello_code  = Int32 2

The library may also include utility functions, for instance, the function
``one_msg`` that creates a list with one entry of type ``Message`` as given
below:

.. code-block:: ocaml

	let one_msg =
  	   fun (msg : Message) =>
           let nil_msg = Nil {Message} in
           Cons {Message} msg nil_msg


At this stage, our contract fragment will have the following form:

.. code-block:: ocaml
	
   library HelloWorld
  
    let one_msg =
        fun (msg : Message) =>
        let nil_msg = Nil {Message} in
        Cons {Message} msg nil_msg

    let not_owner_code  = Int32 1
    let set_hello_code  = Int32 2


    contract HelloWorld
    (owner: Address)

    field welcome_msg : String = ""

    transition setHello (msg : String)
      is_owner = builtin eq owner _sender;
      match is_owner with
      | False =>
        msg = {_tag : "Main"; _recipient : _sender; _amount : Uint128 0; code : not_owner_code};
        msgs = one_msg msg;
        send msgs
      | True =>
        welcome_msg := msg;
        msg = {_tag : "Main"; _recipient : _sender; _amount : Uint128 0; code : set_hello_code};
        msgs = one_msg msg;
        send msgs
      end
    end

Final Touches
*********************

We may now add the second transition ``getHello()`` that allows any caller to be greeted by ``welcome_msg``. The declaration is similar to ``setHello (msg : String)`` accept that ``getHello()`` does not take any parameter. 



.. code-block:: ocaml

    transition getHello ()
        r <- welcome_msg;
        msg = {_tag : Main; _recipient : _sender; _amount : 0; msg : r};
        msgs = one_msg msg;
        send msgs
    end

.. note::
	Reading from a mutable variable is done via the operator ``<-``. In our example, this translates to ``r <- welcome_msg``.

The complete contract that implements the desired specification is given below:

.. code-block:: ocaml

    (* HelloWorld contract *)

    let set_hello_code  = Int32 2

        msg = {_tag : "Main"; _recipient : _sender; _amount : 0; code : not_owner_code};
        msgs = one_msg msg;
        send msgs
      | True =>
        welcome_msg := msg;
        msg = {_tag : "Main"; _recipient : _sender; _amount : 0; code : set_hello_code};
        msgs = one_msg msg;
        send msgs
      end
    end

    transition getHello ()
        r <- welcome_msg;
        msg = {_tag : Main; _recipient : _sender; _amount : 0; msg : r};
        msgs = one_msg msg;
        send msgs
    end



Crowdfunding
###################

In this section, we present a slightly more involved contract that runs a
crowdfunding campaign. In a crowdfunding campaign, a project owner wishes to
raise funds through donations from the community. 

It is  assumed that the owner (``owner``) wishes to run the campaign for a
certain pre-determined period of time (``max_block``). The owner also wishes to
raise a minimum amount of funds (``goal``) without which the project can not be
started. The contract hence has three immutable variables ``owner``,
``max_block`` and ``goal``. 


The campaign is deemed successful if the owner can raise the minimum goal i the
stipulated time. In
case the campaign is unsuccessful, the donations are returned to the project
backers who contributed during the campaign. The contract maintains two mutable
variables: ``backer`` a map between contributor's address and amount
contributed and a boolean flag ``funded`` that indicates whether the owner has already
transferred the funds after the end of the campaign.

The contract contains three transitions: ``Donate ()`` that allows anyone to
contribute to the crowdfunding campaign, ``GetFunds ()`` that allows **only the
owner** to claim the donated amount and transfer it to ``owner`` and
``ClaimBack()`` that allows contributors to claim back their donations in case
the campaign is not successful.

The complete contract is given below:
